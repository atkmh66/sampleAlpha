Subject


Is Agile good for the enterprise?  Yes, but with a wrapper


Agile is supposed to focus in individual relationships over processes and tools,
Focus at the human level is where the best communication will occur.  
Constant open free flowing communication between team members or between teams 

Agils grades on working software more than perfect documentation


Agile looks more to involve the customer collaboratively than to establish contractual obligations
This is good for

Agile is meant to be highly flexible and to be able to changes horses mid stream and go left if necessary
This is good for

Agile is very good at proviing control at the level of project operation.
large companies or enterpirse organizations are not aligned programatically at the project operation level.
A large organization frequently does forecasting at the level of quarterly or yearly forcasting 


What does a wrapper around the agile process give or provide.
The SAFe program sets
A specific number of sprints with an agreed upon goal
Agreed upon goal are usually completions of a specific colleciton of stories equating to specific features or functionality.
Oversight:  SAFe requires a per quarter reveiw of the next development cycle " program increment" 


Change SAFe to one industry framwork.
and it provides Senior leadership visibility and control over product development and deployment. 
It provides a throttle to the rate of functioality that can be provided 
To limit it can resist what is promoted to 



Agile and the bigger picture of Product specifications and requirement documentation
I had a number of good iteas to discuss a week or more ago, but they have all gone awasy cus I wasn't writimg them down.

Argument against :  story is to convey the idea of the functionaoity not how development will be managed 

The issue about how they will be managed is becasue maybe I'm not seeing or feeling enough of a holistic approach.
I don't have much in the way of product documentation, a smaller to bigger or a simple to more complex 





Where does Hode page header documentation belong.

How much does a test automation repository of tocde need to 'document' , eplain what it /they are doing.
to me it seems critical / imperative.  

if the documentation is upto date is upto date , you know what you have.  
With this knowledge , you can decide to add more teesting when you know the product features /funtions / architecture changes.



What are the problems that Agile is supposed to be solving.
How are the solutions , solutions to the problems.

What solution, the wrapper around agile, a solution to ?

address the significant challenges of developing and delivering enterprise-class technology-based solutions 
solution to a need to levels of solution planning.

Portfolio level : 
     solution development is organized around the flow of value through one or more value streams. 
     Here Lean Portfolio Management, Epic Owners and Enterprise Architects prioritize the work and 
     coordinate the flow of value through Solution- and Agile Release Trains (ARTs) by funding them 
     using Participatory Budgeting within Lean Budget Guardrails.

Large Solution:
     Large Solution SAFe is meant for enterprises that face the biggest challenges â€” building large-scale 
     solutions that are beyond the scope of a single ART to develop. Solution Trains are used to coordinate 
     the efforts of multiple ARTs and suppliers. Solution Train Engineers (STEs), Solution Management and 
     Solution Architects together coordinate the delivery of business solutions by the Solution Train and its ARTs.

Essential Solution:
     Essential SAFe contains the minimal set of roles, events, and artifacts required to continuously deliver business solutions via an Agile Release Train (ART) as a Team of Agile Teams.
     The Agile Release Train is a sophisticated metaphor for a virtual organization that allows the continuous flow of value through the combination of teams, roles, and activities directed at continuous, aligned and integrated value delivery.
     Release Train Engineers (RTEs) steer the train by (among other things) facilitating regularly scheduled Program Increment (PI) planning events to align teams on goals with a shared vision.





Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Working software over comprehensive documentation

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Responding to change over following a plan

Agile is some what of a hear and now thenk for team members.
My exposure to sotries doesn't have a long tearm or some what bigger picture perspetcive to them.
But maybe at the story level they shouldden't.  I think they should

end.
